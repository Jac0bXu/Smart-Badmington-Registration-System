Badminton Court Registration System
I propose a smart badminton court registration system for my project 4. Purdue University has a large and active badminton enthusiast community. However, what we do not have is a badminton court registration system. This lack of management system has caused lots of confusion and inconvenience. Because there is usually a higher demand for badminton courts than the actual demand, for me personally, there has been more than a couple times where I showed up to Corec with my rackets and shuttlecocks just to found out that there are no more courts available. This problem’s main stakeholder is badminton players and pickle ball players who uses the badminton court in Corec. Solving this problem is necessary since it can save these people a considerable amount of time.

For my program, I will use a 2D matrix to store the availability of the courts in Corec at a given time. To store an appointment, I will use a structure that will store the name of the person who reserved, a password, and the skill level of the game, and whether they are looking for someone to play with. And then I would have another 2D matrix to store the availability matrix at all times in a week. Then I will create several UDFs to implement the following features. First will be a UDF to display the available time slots during a specified range. Second will be a UDF to make a registration at a given time. Third will be a UDF to cancel registration at a given time. Fourth will be a UDF to visualize the availability at a given time or across a time period. Finally there will be a UDF to allow people to potentially find people to play with, that’s on their skill level.
Overall, with this program, I would like to achieve the ability to organize the availability of the badminton court, and allow people to find people to play with that’s on their skill level.
The following is my system diagram.
